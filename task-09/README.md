# GeoQuest
I've Worked the least for this but since i am writing this in the deadline day i thought i'll push whatever i have...i wasted about 2 days initialising this and rustðŸ˜’ 

my approach was to first to take the example code from the site and then i worked on it a bit...i think i mioght include screenshots from my phone where the map works and my user location works...still have to figure out dist and time calculation and road drawing

(if it doesnt work, welll ggs)`
