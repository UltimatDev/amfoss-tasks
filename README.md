```I am Varunâ€¦```

"This is going to be a professional introduction"- Words that you are never going to utter

the line above is definitely going to be the best sentence in the entire readmeðŸ¤£â€¦now who am I( a qn I ask myself constantlyâ€¦ðŸ˜Œ) â€¦.A James arthurian(he doesn't even know what his fans are called)[he is a British Musician/Angel for any uncultured folks out there]
.. a cold coffee connoisseurâ€¦got a master's in the art of procrastination I am exceptionally good(if I can brag for a sec) at Model UN'sâ€¦.oh I forgot to say where I was fromâ€¦the Queen of the Arabian sea and the King of TrafficðŸ˜” Kochiâ€¦not exactly kochi, I come from a little more rural but still urban place called Tripunithuraâ€¦it has all the comforts that kochi gives while still not loosing the countryside feel and beautyâ€¦I studied there In Bhavans Vidya Mandir, Eroor for a whopping a 14 years(basically most of my lifetime)...

if this line is here then I got lazy and didn't add moreâ€¦


## Why should thy choose me?

"IDK" - was my answer all the way at the start of praveshanâ€¦but, now I know why you guys would want me. The things I have learnt through this process, at a very short span of time is that, if I want to ðŸ˜Š, I can do things coz I make me do what I put my mind to(sneaky eminem ref ;) . I am usually a huge procrastinator but idk what happened for the tasks, I started doing them diligently, falling In love with doing some of them, hating some of them, then understood them(after hours and hours of rigorous head-scratching) and I liked doing most of the tasksâ€¦


## What are your goals for the next six months? 

I've fallen in love again ðŸ˜‰â€¦this time to ui/uxâ€¦these are the tasks I struggled a bit initially but once I got the hang of it, I was a maestro at workâ€¦ I want to relearn html, css since I felt a bit of broken foundation igâ€¦also get a hang of Qt and stuff[since ik it's simpler (but quite innefective, or atleast from what I've done not that effective) cousin in Ui design tkinter]...Qt seems really interesting

And  I want to further my hobby, making gamesâ€¦I want to further unity, so if I've done the godot task just understand I've taken the first step in that direction.

And flutter and kotlin are somethings I desperately wanna learn.

## How will you accomplish them?

My first step every single time is tutorial basedâ€¦have a thing to make, look up how to make said thingâ€¦that has lead to a broken understanding of several programming and designing conceptsâ€¦Something I learnt was that doing stuff helps understanding that stuffðŸ˜…â€¦I've used that approach all throughout this praveshan, tweaking stuff helps better figure out what to doâ€¦also documentation based learning is really essential(I've learned it the hard way doing Hugo). 




## How will you contribute back to the club?

First lemme get in, coz I don't really understand how it works even nowðŸ˜…â€¦but something I've learned through the proces
